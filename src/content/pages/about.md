Everyone needs a personal space on the web apart from the big social media platforms, and now your reading mine. This website is hosted for free using a combination of <a href="https://github.com/" style="text-decoration: none;" onmouseover="this.style.textDecoration = 'underline'" onmouseout="this.style.textDecoration = 'none'">Github</a> and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). It's built using the [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) framework which generates static files so it's lightning fast. The layout is courtesy of the [Foundation](https://github.com/stackrole/gatsby-starter-foundation) theme from [Stackrole](https://stackrole.com/), which leverages [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) for content management. In other words, I took advantage of several awesome free tools and technologies to assemble this website for free, with no coding -- just some light customization to make it my own. If you'd like to do the same thing, you can read all about it here:  [README.md](https://github.com/stackrole/gatsby-starter-foundation/blob/main/README.md)
